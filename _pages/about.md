I'm Shivani, a passionate data scientist with a talent for data-driven storytelling. With a master's degree in data science, alongside a background in mathematics and computer science, and over 3 years of experience in both the banking and health domains, I bring a robust foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, particularly in handling and analyzing large datasets.

My expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable data solutions and advanced analytics frameworks, adaptable across diverse industry domains. I have a proven track record of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence, enabling organizations to optimize processes, enhance customer experiences, and achieve sustainable growth.

As an effective communicator, I excel in translating complex technical concepts into clear insights and strategic recommendations for stakeholders. I foster a culture of data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.

With a continuous search of learning opportunities and a passion for sharing knowledge, I'm currently seeking a challenging role where I can apply my skills and contribute towards driving innovation and success.
