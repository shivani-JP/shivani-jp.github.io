This project focuses on understanding how the airline caters to both business and economy class passengers. Improvements in these services could lead to an increase in the airline's business. Customer satisfaction influences customer loyalty, a factor thoroughly explored in this analysis. We examine factors influencing positive and negative feedback, focusing on areas for improvement in airline services.
